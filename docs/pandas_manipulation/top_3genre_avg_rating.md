# Top 3 Actors by Genre Average Rating

Identify the top 3 actors with the highest average movie ratings within their most frequent (i.e., top) genre. For each actor, return their name, top genre, and average rating in that genre.

Conditions:
* If an actor has multiple top genres (same number of appearances), choose the one with the highest average rating.
* If multiple actors share the same average rating (i.e., a tie in rank), include all tied actors, even if this results in more than 3 total actors. Do not skip rank: if all tied actors share the same rank, the next rank follows sequentially.

```python
import pandas as pd

# group by actor and genre. because if an actor has multiple genre, we take one with highest average rating

groupby_actor_genre = top_actors_ratings.groupby(['actor_name', 'genre']).agg(count_genre=('genre':'count'), avg_rating=('movie_rating':'mean')).reset_index()
