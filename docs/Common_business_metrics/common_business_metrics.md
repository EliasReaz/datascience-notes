| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conversion Rate**           | The % of users who take a desired action (like signing up or buying) **within a specific period**. | If 100 people visit a site **in one day** and 5 make a purchase, conversion rate = 5%. |
| **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**  | The % of people who clicked on a link out of those who saw it **during a campaign or time window**. | If 1,000 people see an ad **over a week** and 50 click on it, CTR = 5%. |
| **Bounce Rate**               | The % of visitors who leave a website after viewing only one page **during a session or time frame**. | High bounce rate **last week** may mean users didnâ€™t find what they wanted. |
| **Churn Rate**                | The % of users or customers who stop using your product or cancel a subscription **within a given time frame** (e.g., monthly). | If you have 100 customers and 5 leave **in January**, churn rate = 5%.  |
| **Retention Rate**            | The % of users who keep using your product **after a certain time period** (e.g., after 1 month). | If 100 people sign up and 60 are still active **after 1 month**, retention = 60%. |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | The average amount spent per purchase, usually calculated **over a time frame** like a day or month. | If 10 orders total \$500 **in a month**, then AOV = \$50.               |
| **Lifetime Value (LTV)**      | The total money a customer is expected to spend over their relationship **typically measured in months or years**. | If a typical customer pays \$20/month for 2 years, LTV = \$480.         |
| **Impressions**               | The number of times your ad or content is shown to users **during a campaign or time window**. | 1,000 people saw your ad **in March** = 1,000 impressions.              |
| **Engagement Rate**           | A measure of how much users interact with your content (likes, comments, clicks) **within a given period**. | 200 likes from 1,000 views **last week** = 20% post engagement rate.    |
| **Upsell**                    | When a customer buys a more expensive version or adds extras **usually within a specific time after initial purchase**. | Buying a laptop and adding an extended warranty **within 30 days**.     |
| **A/B Test Lift**             | The difference (increase or decrease) in a metric between control and variant **measured during the test period**. | If control conversion = 10% and variant = 12% **after 2 weeks test**, lift = +2%. |
