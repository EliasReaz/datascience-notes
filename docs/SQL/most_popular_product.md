### ‚úÖ SQL Answer:

```sql
WITH tbl_PRODUCT_COUNT AS (
  SELECT 
    P.name AS product_name, 
    COUNT(O.product_id) AS order_counts
  FROM orders O 
  JOIN products P ON O.product_id = P.id
  GROUP BY P.name
)
SELECT product_name
FROM tbl_PRODUCT_COUNT
ORDER BY order_counts DESC, product_name ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### üí° Explanation:

* `JOIN` combines order and product info.
* `COUNT(O.product_id)` counts how many times each product was ordered.
* `GROUP BY P.name` groups orders by product.
* `ORDER BY order_counts DESC, product_name ASC` ensures:

  * Most popular product comes first.
  * Alphabetical order is used to break ties.
* `LIMIT 1` returns just the top product.
