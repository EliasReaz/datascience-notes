Click-Through Rate (CTR) The % of people who clicked on a link out of those who saw it during a campaign or time window. If 1,000 people see an ad over a week and 50 click on it, CTR = 5%. Bounce Rate The % of visitors who leave a website after viewing only one page during a session or time frame. High bounce rate last week may mean users didn\u2019t find what they wanted. Churn Rate The % of users or customers who stop using your product or cancel a subscription within a given time frame (e.g., monthly). If you have 100 customers and 5 leave in January, churn rate = 5%. Retention Rate The % of users who keep using your product after a certain time period (e.g., after 1 month). If 100 people sign up and 60 are still active after 1 month, retention = 60%. Average Order Value (AOV) The average amount spent per purchase, usually calculated over a time frame like a day or month. If 10 orders total \\$500 in a month, then AOV = \\$50. Lifetime Value (LTV) The total money a customer is expected to spend over their relationship typically measured in months or years. If a typical customer pays \\$20/month for 2 years, LTV = \\$480. Impressions The number of times your ad or content is shown to users during a campaign or time window. 1,000 people saw your ad in March = 1,000 impressions. Engagement Rate A measure of how much users interact with your content (likes, comments, clicks) within a given period. 200 likes from 1,000 views last week = 20% post engagement rate. Upsell When a customer buys a more expensive version or adds extras usually within a specific time after initial purchase. Buying a laptop and adding an extended warranty within 30 days.

The p-value asks, What's the chance of getting this much evidence against the null hypothesis, or even stronger evidence, if the null hypothesis is actually true?</li> <li>Let's say we think a coin is fair (H\u2080: The coin is fair - the chance of heads is 50%). We toss it 100 times and get only 5 heads. That seems strange, right?</li> <li>The p-value tells us: \"If the coin really is fair, what\u2019s the chance we\u2019d see something as extreme as 5 heads (or fewer)?\"</li> <li>That\u2019s a one-tailed test - looking just at one end (very few heads).</li> <li>A two-tailed test would ask: \"What\u2019s the chance of getting something really extreme on either end - like 5 or fewer heads or 95 or more heads?\"</li> <li>If the p-value is really small (say, less than 0.05), that means our result is pretty unusual under the assumption of fairness. So we might start to doubt the coin is actually fair.</li> </ul> <p>Note 1: A small p-value doesn\u2019t prove the coin is unfair - it just means what we saw would be unlikely if it were fair.</p> <p>Note 2: A small p-value does not mean H\u2080 is false. It means the observed data would be unlikely under H\u2080. It means we fail to reject H$_o$.</p> <pre><code>import scipy.stats as stats\n\n# Set the parameters\nn = 100          # Number of coin tosses\np = 0.5          # Probability of heads under the null hypothesis (fair coin)\nk = 5            # Observed number of heads (very low!)\n\n# ================================================\n# One-tailed p-value:\n# We want the probability of getting k or fewer heads if the coin is fair.\n# That's why we use CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) \u2014 it adds up\n# the probability of 0, 1, 2, ..., up to k heads.\n# If we used PDF, it would only give the probability of *exactly* 5 heads.\n# ================================================\np_value_one_tail = stats.binom.cdf(k, n, p)\nprint(\"One-tailed p-value (5 or fewer heads):\", p_value_one_tail)\n\n# ================================================\n# Two-tailed p-value:\n# We want to find how extreme the result is on *both* sides of the expected value (which is 50 heads).\n# Getting only 5 heads is 45 less than expected \u2192 delta = 45\n# So, we also look at the *other* extreme: 50 + 45 = 95 heads or more\n# CDF gives cumulative up to a value, so for 95 or more, we subtract CDF(94) from 1.\n# ================================================\n\nexpected = n * p                   # Expected number of heads = 50\ndelta = abs(k - expected)         # How far away our result (5) is from expected (50)\n\n# Left tail: probability of getting &lt;= 5 heads (already calculated, but let's redo for clarity)\np_low = stats.binom.cdf(expected - delta, n, p)  # same as stats.binom.cdf(5, 100, 0.5)\n\n# Right tail: probability of getting &gt;= 95 heads\n# Since CDF gives probability of &lt;= x, we subtract from 1 to get &gt;= 95\np_high = 1 - stats.binom.cdf(expected + delta - 1, n, p)  # 1 - CDF(94)\n\n# Add both tails to get the total two-tailed p-value\np_value_two_tail = p_low + p_high\nprint(\"Two-tailed p-value (5 or fewer OR 95 or more heads):\", p_value_two_tail)\n</code></pre>"}]}
